# easyVVUQ-PROCESS: Feasibility Uncertainty Quantification (UQ)

A feasibility study using the PROCESS nuclear fusion power plant systems code and the easyVVUQ framework. It aims to assess the feasibility of two different power plant concepts under epistemic uncertainty.

A DEMO-like design is optimised using PROCESS for maximum net electric output, and a second design optimised for minimum major radius. UQ studies are then performed on these two design points to assess their comparative feasibilities under uncertainty.
