# Few Uncertainties Fast
Run a proof-of-concept sensitivity analysis on Process. This uses a DEMO-like design point (optimised for maximum net electric power) with 4 epistemic uncertainties. Process's models are run once-through for a given value of uncertain inputs according to the Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) sampling method, and the response/quantity of interest is the value of constraints, i.e. the feasibility. The results are the sensitivities (Sobol indicies), presented as a treemap plot.

f-values (extra optimisation parameters used to convert the inequality constraints to equalities to support the legacy solver HYBRD) in the input file are fixed to 1.0; this causes the equality constraints to become inequalities again. This means that the values of the inequalities can be used to assess how satisfied/violated the constraints are.

The job script `run_feasibility.job` only requests a single processor, but Dask is subsequently used to parallelise to 4 "workers" (in this case, processors) in the `feasibility.py` script.
