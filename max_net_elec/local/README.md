# Infeasibility UQ, local evaluations

Infeasibility UQ analysis that can be run locally, e.g. on a laptop, by using few uncertainties. The notebooks include the proof-of-concept `infeas.ipynb` and post-screening analyses. `full_cons` contains responses from individual constraint residuals, rather than just the RMS violated constraints.
